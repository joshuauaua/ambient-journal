Ambient Journal
Ambient Journal is a meditative space where your words become sound. It’s not just about recording your day; it’s about experiencing your thoughts through a unique, real-time soundscape. Every keystroke triggers a generative audio engine, turning the quiet act of reflection into a rich, multisensory event. Once you’ve completed your entry, you can export the session as an audio recording to keep forever.

This is an open-source project built with a React frontend, utilizing Tone.js for all procedural audio functionality.
